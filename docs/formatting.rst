Formatting
==========

Layer formatting
----------------

Layers can be formatted by double-clicking the layer-view (In order to avoid renaming the layer it is best to double-click on the colored square).

Great circles and small circles both appear as lines in the stereonet. One can set the color, thickness, style (solid, dashed), and the capstyle for lines.

Linears appear as points in the stereonet. One can set a fill color, edge color, style (circle, square, etc..), size, and edge thickness for points.
